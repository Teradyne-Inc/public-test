# v0.8 - 2025-09-01

## Breaking Changes

Renamed `TheLib.Validation` to `TheLib.Validate`.

```csharp
// previously
TheLib.Validation.Pins(readPins, out _pins, nameof(readPins));
TheLib.Validation.Pattern(pattern, out _patternInfo, nameof(pattern));
TheLib.Validation.GreaterOrEqual(startIndex, 1, nameof(startIndex));

// now
TheLib.Validate.Pins(readPins, out _pins, nameof(readPins));
TheLib.Validate.Pattern(pattern, out _patternInfo, nameof(pattern));
TheLib.Validate.GreaterOrEqual(startIndex, 1, nameof(startIndex));
```

**Impact:** Potential renaming necessary.

## Bug

### Fixing the bug in Acquire.Measure

Fix the failure of the `.AddRange` method (for `PinSite<Samples<double>>`) by sequentially iterating through each measurement and reordering them based on the pin order defined in `Pins` G�� a temporary solution until `.AddRange` can be used.

## Improvements

### Add `ExtractRange()` feature to `Pins` class

Retrieve a subset of (consecutive) pins from the collection.

```c#
Pins _pins = new("pinA, pinB, pinC");
Pins theFirst= Pins(pins).ExtractRange(0, 1);
```

Users can now use index based subsets or implement serial operations, iterating through all available pins.

### Added Argument Validation Test blocks

Created argument validation test blocks in line with definition(s) within the C#RA documentation. Available argument validation methods are:

**InRange** - Checks if a numeric value is between two bounds.

**GreaterOrEqual** - Checks if a numeric value is greater or equal to a bound.

**LessOrEqual** - Checks if a numeric value is less or equal to bound.

**Pattern** - Checks for valid pattern spec and creates PatternInfo() object.

**Pins** - Checks for valid pin spec and creates Pins() object.

**MethodDelegate** - Checks for valid method spec and creates delegate object.

**MultiCondition** - checks for multicondition validity and creates the data array.

**Enum** - Checks string against provided Enum and returns enum value if applicable.

```c#
TheLib.Validate.InRange(clampVoltage, -2.0, 6.0, nameof(clampVoltage));
TheLib.Validate.GreaterOrEqual(clampVoltage, threshold, nameof(clampVoltage));
TheLib.Validate.LessOrEqual(clampVoltage, threshold, nameof(clampVoltage));

TheLib.Validate.Pattern(Pattern, nameof(Pattern), out PatternInfo patternInfo);
TheLib.Validate.Enum(stringEnum, nameof(stringEnum), out enum enumValue);
TheLib.Validate.Pins(pinList, nameof(pinList), out Pins pins);

TheLib.Validate.MultiCondition(string values, s => type.Parse(s), nameof(values), out type[] conditions, int? numConditions);
TheLib.Validate.MethodHandle(fullyQualifiedMethodName, nameof(fullyQualifiedMethodName), out MethodHandle<T> method);
```

**Impact:** This will allow for the user to deploy argument validation on Common test methods, resulting in a much quicker way of identifying invalid arguments.

### Added Fail() Validation block

Fail() validation block is intended to raise an unconditional validation error when called.

```c#
TheLib.Validate.Fail(problemReasonResolutionMethod, nameof(Argument));
```

**Impact:** Provides a method that users can utilize when working with arguments that do not have existing validation methods.

### Added IsTrue() to available Argument Validation Methods

IsTrue() is a generic validation check that can't be connected to a single parameter only (like illegal combination of parameters).

```c#
TheLib.Validate.IsTrue(condition, problemReasonResolutionMessage, nameof(condition));
```

**Impact:** This is meant to be a fallback for ANY checks. Allows for argument validation where the check cannot be connected to a single parameter.

### Generate Visual Studio Solution file for the Demo project

Added a new command script `_LoadDemoProgram.cmd` that generates a Visual Studio solution file `Demo_Generated.sln` in the Demo directory. 
```
_LoadDemoProgram.cmd
```

### Implement layer for multiple transaction handlers

TransactionService now allows to add multiple transaction handlers and to switch usage between them.

Currently no impact for the user, as this is just the layer without functionality.

### Implemented empty TransactionService methods 

Implementation of all methods for future use in TransactionService. Currently only the methods without functionality exist, this will be implemented later.

```c#
N/A - examples will be available in future merges when functionality is implemented.
```

No impact for the user in this early implementation phase.

### Remove workaround for FunctionalTestLimit bug

FunctionalTestLimit threw an exception if multiple sites and usage of site generics. As workaround conversion to SiteBoolean was implemented. This was fixed in IG-XL V11 Alpha Kit, thus workaround was removed.

```c#
N/A
```

There is no impact for the user, no changes in the API.

#### Implementation of Continuity.Parametric.Serial

A testing method is added that performs continuity testing on pins sequentially.
The branch includes the test method, unit tests, and documentation.
