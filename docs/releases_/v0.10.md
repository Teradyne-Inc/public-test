# v0.10 - 2025-10-02

## Breaking Changes

### Dropping 10.60.xx Support

The C#RA isn't supporting any 10.60.xx version of IG-XL.

**Impact:** Customer needs to update to at least 11.00.00.

### AlertService.ValidationFail Use-Model Change

Instead of inserting the `argumentName` as string, the `argumentIndex` is now needed to mark in IG-XL the offending column.

```c#
// previously
public void ValidationFail(string failMessage, string argumentName = "");
// new
public void ValidationFail(string failMessage, int argumentIndex);
```

**Impact:** Refactor use of AlertService.ValidationFail.

## Bug Fixes 

### Missing Nuget Package

The `v0.9` of C#RA package had an issue with a missing nuget package. This has been fixed with conditional loading of that particular nuget package.

## Improvements

### New SDK-project format 

The C#RA project is now using the new SDK format. 

**Impact:** Users who use IG-Link to generate C#RA projects must ensure they are running Oasis version 4.5.10501 or higher.

### Supporting IG-XL 11.00.01 Patch

The C#RA-Team is excited to announce that `Csra` now officially supports the IG-XL 11.00.01 Patch!
