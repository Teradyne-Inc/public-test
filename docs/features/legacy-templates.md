# Templates

Templates (Functional_T, PPMU_T, Empty_T, ...) have been part of IG-XL from day 1 on. Their best days are oevr, but they still have a loyal user base, who already repeatedly asked for .NET versions of them. They serve these aspects:

- provide canned functionality for common test scenarios
- reflect (what used to be) recommended practice 
- dramatically short-cut test development: fill out a form
- allow customization

There's a great overlap with the high level goals of the C# Reference Architecture, and reproducing their exact functionality with it is an important check step. This isn't questioning how reasonable the originally defined scope (too many parameters? Too generic?) is, but rather proof-of-concept that the essential components are available and working together.

Aside from the exact representations of the legacy templates, more streamlined and modern ones are offered. Users **could** use the original ones in .NET if they wanted, but they could also decide for better ones that are offered in addition.
