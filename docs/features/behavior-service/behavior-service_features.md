# Behavior Service - Features

This page lists known BehaviorService features for reference and to encourage consistent naming and usage patterns across projects. It is not the responsibility of the BehaviorService itself to define or track these — each client is free to define and manage its own set of features as needed.

| Feature | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [`Datalog.Parametric.OfflinePassResults`](../offline-features.md#use-offline-pass-results) | `bool` | use always-passing results for offline datalogs |
