Before diving into debugging the C#RA project, it's highly recommended to review the [official guide](https://myinfo-support.teradyne.com/documentation/r/Debugging-with-.NET-in-IG-XL/IGXL11.00.00) on debugging C# projects. This guide covers essential techniques and best practices that apply directly to C#RA and similar libraries.
