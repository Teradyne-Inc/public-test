# Suggest a Documentation Fix

Found a typo, outdated info, or something unclear in the documentation? You can easily suggest improvements directly through GitHub!

Each page on our documentation site includes an "Edit this page" button—usually located at the top or bottom of the page. Clicking it will take you to the corresponding Markdown file on GitHub, where you can:

- Propose edits directly in your browser.
- Submit a **Pull Request (PR)** with your suggested changes.

> [!TIP]
> You don't need to clone the repository or install anything locally - just a GitHub account is enough to contribute.

> [!NOTE]
> All contributions are reviewed before being merged, so feel free to suggest even small improvements. Every fix helps.
