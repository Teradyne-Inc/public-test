# Use Test Method

Before using a Test Method from the Csra library, make sure you've completed the [IG-XL Reference](installation.md#ig-xl-reference) step. This ensures that IG-XL can access the compiled Csra.dll and recognize the available TestMethods.

- Open **IG-XL**.
- Navigate to the `Test Instance Sheet`.
- Enter the desired Test Method name (e.g., **Csra.Continuity.Parametric.Parallel**).
- Provide the required parameters for the selected method.
- Run **IG-XL** to execute the test.

> [!NOTE]
> The available TestMethods are defined in the Csra project. Make sure to consult the documentation or the source code to understand the expected parameters and behavior.
